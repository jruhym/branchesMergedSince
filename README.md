# branchesMergedSince
A python scrip to show all of the branches merged since an input date.
## Usage
`branchesMergedSince.py "Mar 9, 2019 at 10:30 AM"`
## Caveats
- The app has the Eastern time zone hard-coded and I think it doesn't take daylight-savings time into account.
- The date format for the input is hard-coded. It matches that used by itunesconnect.apple.com
